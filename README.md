# Day 6 – Sum & Average of Array (C++)

## Problem Statement
Write a C++ program to calculate the sum and average of elements in an array.
The program uses a predefined array of floating-point numbers and processes it
using loop-based traversal.

## Objective
- Traverse an array using loops
- Calculate the sum of all array elements
- Compute the average of the array elements
- Understand the role of array length in average calculation

## Approach
1. Declare a double array to store numeric values.
2. Determine the length of the array using the sizeof operator.
3. Use a for loop to traverse the array and calculate the sum.
4. Divide the sum by the number of elements to calculate the average.
5. Display the sum and average using standard output.

## Concepts Used
- One-dimensional arrays
- for loop
- Arithmetic operations
- sizeof operator
- Floating-point precision

## Output
The program displays:
- The sum of all elements in the array
- The average of the array elements

## Learning Outcome
- Learned how to iterate through arrays efficiently
- Understood correct average calculation logic
- Avoided unnecessary loops in computation
- Strengthened basic array manipulation concepts

## Conclusion
This challenge helps build a strong foundation in array processing using C++.
The concepts learned here are essential for solving more complex programming
problems involving data collections.
